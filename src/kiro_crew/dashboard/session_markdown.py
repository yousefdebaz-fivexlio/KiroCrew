"""Render an export bundle as Markdown — the human-readable export format.

``GET /api/chat/slots/{slot}/export?format=md`` answers
``<title-slug>-<stamp>.kcsession.md`` instead of the gzipped JSON bundle.

**Why a second format rather than a second endpoint.** The JSON bundle is a
*transfer* document: ``session_transfer`` validates it on the way back in, so
every byte in it is there for the importer. A person reading a past conversation
needs the opposite document — one a text editor opens, a forge renders, and a
reader skims. Those are two renderings of the same assembled bundle, not two
sources of truth, so this module is a pure renderer over the bundle
``session_export`` already builds: the slot lookup, the app-scope checks, the
restricted-session refusal, the transcript locking and the egress redaction all
stay in one place and are shared.

**It installs nowhere, so it carries no Layer B.** Markdown is a one-way door:
nothing reads it back, and ``session_export`` passes ``include_layer_b=False``
for this format unconditionally — not as an operator choice. The model's context
window is byte-exact and unredacted (``session_transfer._read_layer_b``), and a
document whose whole purpose is being pasted into a review, a ticket or a chat is
the last place it may appear.

**Streamed, never assembled.** :func:`write_markdown_file` writes a message at a
time into a temp file under the export staging directory, the same way
``session_transfer.write_bundle_file`` does, because a long session's rendered
text is far too much to hold resident. :func:`iter_session_markdown` is the pure
generator behind it, which is what the tests drive.

**Message content is written verbatim.** Transcript content is already Markdown —
that is what the dashboard renders — so escaping it would destroy the fenced code
blocks, tables and lists this format exists to preserve.

Two structural risks follow from that, and :func:`_unterminated_blocks` resolves
them at the message boundary. A turn ending inside an unterminated code fence
swallows every later turn into one code block; a turn ending inside an
unterminated HTML construct — a comment, a ``<script``/``<pre``/``<style``/
``<textarea`` block, a ``<?`` instruction, a ``<!`` declaration, ``<![CDATA[``,
an element a browser reads as raw text until its own close tag such as
``<title>`` or ``<iframe>``, or one it parses but does not display such as
``<template>`` or ``<dialog>`` — hides every later turn from the renderer
entirely. Both are *silent* read-time loss — the text is in the file and no
reader sees it — which is why they are closed rather than escaped.

**The guard can cause the very loss it prevents, so nothing here guesses.** A
manufactured closer is itself content, and a bare ````` ``` ````` line is a valid
*opener*: closing a construct that was never open swallows the rest of the
document exactly as leaving a real one open does. A hand-written CommonMark
scanner cannot get this right, because every container rule (list item, quote,
HTML block) changes where a fence ends. So this module does not decide: it
asks. Each message is parsed by a CommonMark reference implementation
(``markdown-it-py``) exactly as it will land in the file — followed by the
separator and a stand-in for the next role heading — and a closer is added only
when that parser reports the heading swallowed, and only the closer the
swallowing block itself names. The rendered HTML is then read by a small HTML
tokenizer for what a *browser* would still have open — a comment, an unfinished
tag, a raw-text element — and that is closed too. Every closer is re-verified
by the same parse before it is accepted, so a closer that would have opened
something is never emitted.

**What verbatim content can still do, and why that is accepted.** A message body
is written at the same heading depth as :func:`_message_heading`, so content
holding a line like ``## Assistant — <ts>`` renders as a turn this session never
produced. Closing that hole means either escaping content — which destroys the
fenced blocks and tables this format exists for — or wrapping each body in a
container, which no Markdown construct provides without the same escaping. The
JSON bundle stays the fidelity document; this one is a reading copy, and a reader
who needs provenance for a specific line has the bundle. The two risks above are
different in kind: they make the file *unreadable* rather than *misleading*, and
they cost nothing to close.

    Message content is written verbatim, so a turn that ends inside a code fence
    would make every following role heading render as code, and a turn that ends
    inside an HTML comment, an HTML block or a raw-text element would hide them
    from the renderer altogether. Either way the whole rest of the conversation
    disappears at read time while staying present in the file, which is the
    failure mode worth paying a parse for.

    Decided by parsing, never by scanning (see the module docstring). Each pass
    parses the message with the closers chosen so far, exactly as the file will
    carry them, and asks two questions in order:

    1. **Markdown.** Does the stand-in for the next heading parse as a top-level
       heading? If a fence or a terminator-ended HTML block swallowed it, that
       block's own closer is added (:func:`_markdown_need`).
    2. **HTML.** With the Markdown closed, does a browser reading the rendered
       output still have a comment, an unfinished tag or a raw-text element
       open? Those are closed in browser order (:class:`_RenderedState`).

    A closer added by one pass is verified by the next: it is parsed as content,
    so one that opened something would show up as the next thing to close, and
    one that fixed nothing is followed by the next layer rather than repeated.
    The order matters and falls out of the loop: a fence is closed before the
    comment it hid, and an element opened inside ``<pre>`` is closed before the
    ``</pre>`` that ends both the element's container and the Markdown block.

    A fence inside a list item or block quote draws no closer, and needs none:
    the separator that follows every message is dedented past the item and
    separated from the quote by a blank line, which ends the container and the
    fence with it — and the parser, seeing the stand-in heading intact, says so.

    Bounded by passes, not by how many closers one pass emits (:data:`_MAX_CLOSERS`):
    a pass can close any number of simultaneously-open elements at once, and the
    loop never trusts a batch just because it was the one that reached the
    budget. The last pass is always a verification, whether or not it added
    anything: raises :class:`ValueError` rather than returning a closer this
    module cannot prove closes everything, since an unverified guess the
    browser still reads as open is the one outcome worse than failing the export.
