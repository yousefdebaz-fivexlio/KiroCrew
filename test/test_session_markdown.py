"""Tests for the Markdown rendering of an export bundle.

The emphasis is the one thing a Markdown export can get structurally wrong:
message content is written VERBATIM so its fenced code blocks survive, which
means a turn that ends inside an unterminated fence would swallow every later
turn into one code block, and one ending inside an unterminated ``<!--`` would
hide them from the renderer entirely. That is silent data loss at read time — the
text is in the file but no renderer shows it — so the balancing cases are pinned
first, including the CommonMark rules that decide what actually opens and closes
each construct.

The opener rules get as much weight as the closers, because a MIS-detected opener
is worse than no guard at all: it makes the renderer append a closer that is
itself a valid opener, causing the very loss the guard exists to prevent.

The rest holds the document's shape: the role headings and timestamps a reader
navigates by, the provenance table, and the table-cell escaping that is the one
place content cannot be verbatim.
